# ATM-
This project is a basic Python-based simulation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). The program allows a user to insert a card (via input), enter a PIN, and then choose between checking their balance, withdrawing money, or depositing funds. The user interface is text-based and uses simple conditional statements to control the flow.
